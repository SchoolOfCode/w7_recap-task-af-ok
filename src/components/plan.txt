Code Breakdown
App
    import React
    import exampleBlog from data (blog.js)
    import BlogPost
    import useState
    

    State
        - comments: an array of comments objects
        -  each object formatted as
            - {id: string, author: string,content: string}
    
    Functions (handleCommentSubmit)
        - Function which can take in an author and comment
        - creates a new comment object and adds it to the comments state
        - 

BlogPost (done)
    import React

    
    Takes Prop (will use object from data/blogs.js)
        - the object will have the following shape 
        - {title: string, author: string, datePosted: string, content: string, 
          imageSrc: string,imageAlt: string,}


CommentList (done)
    import React

            Takes props (which is the comments state (in App)) (done)

CommentForm 
    import React

        State
        - Can have states to track the user's inputs

        - Takes props handleSubmit as onSubmit prop
        - Attatches this to the onSubmit button which is part of the form.


        Behaviours
            - If the comment is empty do not call onSubmit
        
        <input>
            <text> Author</text>
            <input></input>

             <text> Comment</text>
             <textarea></textarea>

             <button onSubmit={handleCommentSubmit}></button>
        <input>
